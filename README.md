# IT-Expenditure-Dashboard

This dashboard allows you to track and manage your expenses (as an individual or as a business). With this dashboard, you’ll be able to compare your current expenses with your planned expenses to determine if you’re overspending, underspending, or spending as budgeted.

Additionally, it lets you see what exactly you’re spending money on, and whether (or not) there are opportunities to lower your expenses further.
